## Story time

I was born in March 16th, 1993, in country called Uzbekistan, city [Angren](https://goo.gl/maps/MrE6kK48Y3tzF2u47). Very small city and to be honest all my best childhood memories are coming from that little city. Which at that time felt big.

When I was 3 my family moved to Kyrgyzstan, city Bishkek, neighbor country. This is where my mom is originally from and my dad was from Uzbekistan. Unfortunately they divorced early in my life, I don't have memories about that time. Just one vague memory of them speaking loudly. However that's about it.

Ever since I was small I had interest in computer, primarily in games. I would play games all day after school. The first bright memory of a game is Quake3. After that I found out about World of Warcraft from one of my friends and quickly jumped on that train. At that time internet was very expensive, and ISP had a thing like 'local' and 'outside' internet. Essentially local is everything in Kyrgyzstan area which had '.kg' on domain name. It had a very little to none pay rate per megabyte. And as you already guessed 'outside' is everything outside .kg zone.

Because of crazy internet costs and since I was only 12 at a time I could not pay for it and pay for WoW monthly subscription, I spent most of my time roaming around pirate servers which thankfully was in .kg zone and we had plenty of players out there.
